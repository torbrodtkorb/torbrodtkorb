# Hi there :raised_hand:, im Tor
Most of my projects involve PCB design, 3D modeling, prototyping of mechanical parts, and software development. I typically utilize tools such as a 3D printer, laser cutter, and lathe, along with other hand tools, To bring my projects to life.

### :hammer: Current project
In my current project, I am designing and building my own CNC milling machine. I am almost done with the research phase and have already designed the Z-gantry and some of the X-gantry in CAD. Soon coming on GitHub...
