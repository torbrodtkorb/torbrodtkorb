# Hi there :raised_hand:, im Tor
Most of my projects contain PCB design, 3D modeling, prototyping of mechanical part and software development. I usually use tolls like 3D printer, laser cutter, and lathe, along with other hand tools to make my projects come true.

### ðŸ–¥ Skills

- 3D-printing
- Laser cutting
- software development (mostly python and C)

    In my current project, I am designing and building my own CNC milling machine. I am almost done with the research phase and have already designed the z-gantry and some of the x-gantry in CAD.
