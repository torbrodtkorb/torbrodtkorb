# Hi there :raised_hand:, I'm Tor

Most of my projects contain PCB design, 3D modeling, prototyping of mechanical parts, and software development. I usually use tools like a 3D printer, laser cutter, and lathe, along with other hand tools to bring my projects to life.

### ðŸ–¥ Skills

- PCB design
- 3D printing
- Laser cutting
- Software development (mostly Python and C)

### :hammer: Current project

In my current project, I am designing and building my own CNC milling machine. I am almost done with the research phase and have already designed the z-gantry and some of the x-gantry in CAD.
