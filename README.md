# Hi there :raised_hand:
About me:
Soon to have a masterâ€™s degree in Electronic Systems Design and Innovation, with a specialization in embedded system.

I was first introduced to PCB design and microchip programming. I have since then made over a dozen PCBs in Altium Designer and I have also written software for most of them. In the last tree years I have gained more interest in 3D modeling and prototyping. With the assistance of tools such as a 3D printer, laser cutter, and lathe, along with hand tools, many of my projects over the past year feature custom 3D designed parts and mechanical components that I have created. 

In my current project i am designing my own CNC milling machine.
